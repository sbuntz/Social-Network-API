## Description
An API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. This application uses Express, Node, MongoDB and Mongoose to allow users, thoughts, friend lists and thought reactions to be created, updated and deleted.

[Here is the link for how the app works in Insomina](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/npxF7XSbWmlumbyuvk8C).

## Installation

Check whether you have MongoDB installed on your computer otherwise you will need to download it as MongoDB is the database structure for the app.
